# Jeanne d'Arc Skillbinding Quick-Reference Guide Web App

## Info

This simple web app takes info about Jeanne d'Arc's skillbinding system from multiple faqs and puts it in an easy to search format to make grinding a bit easier and more time-efficient. Just click the name of the skill stone that interests you to view info about it. This is a reworked version of [something I made earlier](http://github.com/cjbennett/jeannedarc). It was built with Tomcat6 in mind.
